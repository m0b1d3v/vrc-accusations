# VRChat Accusations

## What is this?

- This aims to be an archive of credible and vetted submitted accusations of VRChat individuals in the rave scene
- A resource to maintain the "why" of some individuals being removed from spaces is important
- A more accessible and transparent information source than ephemeral or gated resources like social media posts

## What this is not

- 100% accurate and unshakable proof of moral character, please read the evidence and make your own judgement
- Open for any/all accusations, random public instance racists or non-credible hearsay will likely be filtered
- Actively updated without community input, chances of anything being added without being sent to me is low
- Guaranteed to last very long or beyond the first public outcry that I'm performing a witch hunt or similar

## What this might be

- For the foreseeable future this will be version-controlled text with links to and copies of screenshots and documents
- Depending on demand and reception a searchable website with more functionality might be implemented
- There  is discussion of an OSC program that sends a Discord message on someone from this site joining your instance
